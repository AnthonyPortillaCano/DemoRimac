Feature: Logging and Monitoring
  As a system administrator
  I want to track system performance and errors
  So that I can maintain system health and troubleshoot issues

  Background:
    Given the logging service is active
    And monitoring systems are configured
    And log levels are set appropriately

    When the request is processed
    Then the request should be logged
    And the log should include request details
    And the log should include response time
    And the log should include user information if authenticated

  Scenario: Log failed API requests

    When the failure occurs
    Then the failure should be logged
    And the log should include error details
    And the log should include stack trace if available
    And the log should include request context

  Scenario: Log authentication events
    Given a user attempts to authenticate
    When authentication is processed
    Then the authentication attempt should be logged
    And the log should include success/failure status
    And the log should include user identifier
    And the log should include IP address

  Scenario: Log rate limiting events
    Given a user exceeds rate limits
    When rate limiting is enforced
    Then the rate limiting event should be logged
    And the log should include user information
    And the log should include limit details
    And the log should include IP address

  Scenario: Log database operations
    Given a database operation is performed
    When the operation completes
    Then the operation should be logged
    And the log should include operation type
    And the log should include execution time
    And the log should include success/failure status

  Scenario: Log external API calls
    Given an external API is called
    When the call completes
    Then the API call should be logged
    And the log should include API endpoint
    And the log should include response time
    And the log should include success/failure status

  Scenario: Log system errors
    Given a system error occurs
    When the error is handled
    Then the error should be logged
    And the log should include error details
    And the log should include stack trace
    And the log should include system context

  Scenario: Log performance metrics
    Given a system operation is performed
    When performance metrics are collected
    Then the metrics should be logged
    And the log should include execution time
    And the log should include memory usage
    And the log should include CPU usage

  Scenario: Log security events
    Given a security-related event occurs
    When the event is processed
    Then the security event should be logged
    And the log should include event type
    And the log should include severity level
    And the log should include user context

  Scenario: Configure log levels
    Given different log levels are available
    When log level is configured
    Then appropriate messages should be logged
    And less important messages should be filtered
    And log volume should be manageable

  Scenario: Log rotation and retention
    Given log files are generated
    When log rotation is configured
    Then old log files should be archived
    And log storage should be managed
    And retention policies should be enforced

  Scenario: Log aggregation and search
    Given logs are generated across multiple services
    When log aggregation is configured
    Then logs should be centralized
    And logs should be searchable
    And logs should be correlated by timestamp

  Scenario: Log alerting and notifications
    Given critical events occur
    When alerting is configured
    Then administrators should be notified
    And alerts should include relevant log information
    And alert thresholds should be configurable

  Scenario: Log performance monitoring
    Given system performance is monitored
    When performance thresholds are exceeded
    Then performance alerts should be triggered
    And performance metrics should be logged
    And trend analysis should be available

  Scenario: Log user activity tracking
    Given user activities are tracked
    When user actions are performed
    Then user activities should be logged
    And the log should include user identifier
    And the log should include action details
    And the log should include timestamp

  Scenario: Log API usage analytics
    Given API endpoints are used
    When usage statistics are collected
    Then API usage should be logged
    And the log should include endpoint information
    And the log should include usage patterns
    And the log should include user demographics

  Scenario: Log system health checks
    Given system health is monitored
    When health checks are performed
    Then health check results should be logged
    And the log should include system status
    And the log should include component health
    And the log should include response times

  Scenario: Log configuration changes
    Given system configuration is modified
    When configuration changes are applied
    Then configuration changes should be logged
    And the log should include change details
    And the log should include user who made changes
    And the log should include timestamp

  Scenario: Log backup and recovery events
    Given backup operations are performed
    When backup events occur
    Then backup events should be logged
    And the log should include backup status
    And the log should include backup size
    And the log should include completion time

  Scenario: Log network and connectivity events
    Given network events occur
    When connectivity issues arise
    Then network events should be logged
    And the log should include connection status
    And the log should include latency information
    And the log should include error details

  Scenario: Log resource utilization
    Given system resources are monitored
    When resource usage is tracked
    Then resource utilization should be logged
    And the log should include CPU usage
    And the log should include memory usage
    And the log should include disk usage

  Scenario: Log business metrics
    Given business operations are performed
    When business metrics are collected
    Then business metrics should be logged
    And the log should include transaction counts
    And the log should include revenue information
    And the log should include user engagement

  Scenario: Handle log storage efficiently
    Given logs are continuously generated
    When storage space is limited
    Then log compression should be applied
    And old logs should be archived
    And storage quotas should be enforced

  Scenario: Ensure log security and privacy
    Given sensitive information may be logged
    When logs are generated
    Then sensitive data should be masked
    And access to logs should be restricted
    And log encryption should be applied if needed
