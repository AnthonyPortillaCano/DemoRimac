    Then file type should be verified
    And file size should be checked
    And file content should be scanned for malware
    And only safe files should be accepted

  Scenario: Validate authentication tokens
    Given an authentication token

  Scenario: Validate date formats
    Given date fields with various formats
    When I validate the dates
    Then valid date formats should be accepted
    And invalid date formats should be rejected
    And date ranges should be reasonable

  Scenario: Validate currency amounts
    Given currency amount fields
    When I validate the amounts
    Then amounts should be numeric
